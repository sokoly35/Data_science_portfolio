# Data Science Portfolio
Data science portfolio which contains projects done by me for self-learning and hobby purposes. Every project is presented in IPython Notebook. If the file don't want to render, I recommend pasting its link in [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).


## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

     - [Music Genre Classification](https://github.com/sokoly35/Data_science_portfolio/blob/main/music%20genre%20classification/Music%20Genre%20Classificator.ipynb): A model that classificates given audio file by its genre. It is step by step data science project from Data preparation, by spot-checking algorithms to present results.
     - [Cat vs Dog Classification](https://github.com/sokoly35/Data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Dog%20vs%20Cat%20classification/cat%20vs%20dog%20project.ipynb): Classification of dogs and cats images using deep learning with tensorflow. In projects are used methods like data augmentation and transfer learning.

     Tools: Scickit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, tensorflow

- ### Time Series Analysis

     - [Warm-up Predictions](https://github.com/sokoly35/Data_science_portfolio/tree/main/warm%20up%20predictions): One of Why R? hackathon's challenge. The project includes step by step modeling time series with SARIMA model.

     Tools: Statsmodels, Pandas, Seaborn
     
- ### Natural Language Processing

     - [Fake News Detector](https://github.com/sokoly35/Fake_news): Binary classification problem. An introduction to nlp including data preprocessing with regular expressions and tools like TfIdf.

     Tools: Scickit-learn, Pandas, Spacy, Re
     
This repository and projects which it contains can be in progress. If any project don't have description so work is in progress.
