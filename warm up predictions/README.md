# Warm-up prediction

If you have any problems with rendering IPython Notebook file I recommend to paste its link in [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Overview

This is one of the challenges from Why R? Hackathon intended for warming up participants. The task is to perform time-series analysis on hacker's news service's data downloaded from API, and after that our forecasts should minimize custom loss function. For more details about hackathon, I encourage visiting hackathon's repo in link [here](https://github.com/WhyR2020/hackathon#descriptions-of-challenges).

## Motivation

I decided to do this project because of my Scientific club of mathematical statistics "GAUSS". It was a series of college lectures in which we described our progress. The purpose was to get more familiar with time-series analysis, so this project has an introductionary form.

## Errors

If you found any mistakes in the project, please let me know about in [here](https://github.com/sokoly35/Data_science_portfolio/issues) adding a short note that it is from this project.
