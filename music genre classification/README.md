# Music Genre Classification

If you have any problems with rendering IPython Notebook file I recommend to paste its link in [Jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Overview

In this project we use [GTZAN](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html) dataset to classify the genre of given audio sample. It is very popular challenge to start processing audio,
with libraries like librosa. We focus to maximize obtained accuracy. The project doesn't foresee using advanced deep learning methods.
Code has a certain structure which I learned from one of [machine learning mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/process-for-working-through-machine-learning-problems/)
articles. 

## Motivation

I decided to do this project beacause of my bachelor's thesis, which discuse about Hidden Markov models in speech recognition. I wanted to improve 
my knowledge in audio data processing area. Moreover, I wanted to check framework provided by Jason Brownlee in his article provided in link from the overview section.
I really recommend reading it!
